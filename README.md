The game's purpose is to tell the player what kind of studying style is best suited for him/her in HAMK University of Applied Sciences. The game is played on a 42 inch touch screen TV and is intended to be available to play in different kind of events and fairs. The game's language is in Finnish.

My responsibilities included programming and design. This was my first project using Three.js and Tween.js JavaScript libraries and my first time to create a game in 3D. Pictures, video, music and questions for this project were provided by school.

This was a summer school project.
